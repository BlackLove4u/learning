    <h1>The Superpower of a Big Heart</h1>
    <p>Why the Kindest Souls Often Suffer the Most</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>
      Some people were born with something special. A rare kind of soul. They carry within them
      more compassion, more love, more empathy than most people will ever understand. These are the big-hearted ones.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “With great power comes great responsibility.” — Uncle Ben (Spider-Man)
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Why Do They Suffer So Much?</h2>
    <p>
      It’s not because they are weak — it’s because they are strong enough to keep going.
      People with big hearts are often targets for those with dark intentions. Narcissists,
      manipulators, and wounded souls search for light, not to admire it, but to dim it.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>
        <strong>Big-hearted people love deeply, forgive easily, and believe in second chances.</strong>
        That’s why they get hurt more often — because they dare to believe in what’s good,
        even when it hurts.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Chosen Ones</h2>
    <p>
      Some say they are “chosen.” That their journey is harder because their mission is greater.
      That they were given more emotional weight to carry so they could rise above it and help others heal too.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “The strongest hearts have the most scars.” — Unknown
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Their pain has a purpose. It teaches them to be healers, mentors, protectors. Their heartache
      becomes their gift to the world.
    </p>

    <h2>What Makes This a Superpower?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>They love when it's easier to hate.</li>
      <li>They forgive when revenge is justified.</li>
      <li>They stay kind when life gives them every reason to turn cold.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Many don’t understand this strength and try to change them — to toughen them up, to numb
      their love. But something precious is lost when we stop believing in goodness.
    </p>

    <h2>To the Big-Hearted Souls</h2>
    <p>
      This article is for you. You who cry in secret but show up for others. You who are told you’re
      too sensitive, too emotional, too kind. Never let go of who you are.
    </p>

    <p>
      The world needs your love. Your strength. Your light.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “People with a good heart suffer the most, but they change the world the most too.” — Original Quote
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Advice for Staying True to Yourself</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Practice self-love and protection — your light needs care too.</li>
      <li>Surround yourself with those who see your strength, not just your softness.</li>
      <li>Know when to walk away from what dims you.</li>
      <li>Turn your story into someone else’s survival guide.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>You are not broken. You are built differently. You are made for something bigger.</strong>
    </div>

    <h2>This Is Just the Beginning</h2>
    <p>
      This article is the first in a 3-part series meant to uplift and empower hearts like yours.
      You have something the world needs, and this space will always remind you of that.
